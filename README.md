# Sourcing and working with raster data - satellite imagery
This repo contains small example notebooks showing how to source raster data from STAC (spatio-temporal asset catalog) and OGC Web service endpoints. resources used to write these notebooks will be provided at the end of this readme doc.

## Why does this repo exist?
Raster data (mostly satellite imagery) are available online in ever-growing volumes. One of the recurring challenges for those new to the fields of GIS and remote sensing is learning how to colelct and work with this data. I want this repository to serve as a resource for people looking for examples of how to work with raster data from online sources in python.

While not written specifically for arcpy or pyqgis, I hope the code presented in these notebooks can be a starting point if you are working in either of these systems.
